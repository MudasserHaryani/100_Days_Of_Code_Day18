/*ðŸš€ Day 18 Challenge: Start Coding! ðŸš€

Question 52: Make a Smartphone Object: Create a simple way to keep track of a smartphone's details. Include its brand, model, and other key features like how much storage it has, the size of its screen, and how long its battery lasts.*/


//Set up details about smartphone 
let smartPhone = {
    make: "Xiaomi",
    model: "Note 12 Pro",
    specs:{
        storage: "256GB",
        ScreenSize: "6.3 inches",
        batterCapacity: "5000 mAh"
    }
};

// Shows what we've set up about the smartphone

console.log(smartPhone);


//Question 53: Pulling Apart a Nested Object: Imagine you have a list inside another list that shows what a computer programmer knows, like coding languages, tools, and software frameworks. Find a way to get three specific skills from this list and show them.

// A list showing a programmer's skills in detail 
let developerSkills = {
    languages: ["JavaScript", "Typescript", "Python"],
    frameworks: ["React", "Angular", "Vue"],
    tools: ["Git", "Webpack", "Docker"]
};

// Getting specific skills from the list 
let {languages, frameworks, tools} = developerSkills;

//Showing a skill from each category
console.log(`Language: ${languages[0]}. Framework: ${frameworks[0]}, Tool: ${tools[0]}`);

console.log(`Language: ${languages[1]}. Framework: ${frameworks[1]}, Tool: ${tools[1]}`);

console.log(`Language: ${languages[2]}. Framework: ${frameworks[2]}, Tool: ${tools[2]}`);


/*Question 54: Making Flexible Object Keys: Learn how to set up a list where you can change the name of each section based on what you need at that moment, like adjusting labels based on user choices.*/

// A way to make a flexible list
function createObjectWithDynamicKey(key: string, value: string){
    let dynamicObject = {};
    //Setting up a section in the list with a changeable name
    dynamicObject[key] = value;
    return dynamicObject;
}

//Using the flexible list setup for a user's preference
let userPreference = createObjectWithDynamicKey("theme", "dark");

//Showing the user's choice
console.log(userPreference);
